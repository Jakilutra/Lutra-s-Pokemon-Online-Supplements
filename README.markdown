#Lutra's Pokemon Online Server Script

Created by Lutra(Jakilutra) for use with servers of the Online Pokemon Battle Simulator - [Pokemon Online] (https://github.com/coyotte508/pokemon-online)
The files were made public in order to benefit users and hosts of servers with useful functionality via commands and files.

## Server Script

The Server Script is entirely coded in JavaScript and began as a tournament script.

### Setup

Download either `autoupdatescript/scripts.js` (updates the full script every time the script is loaded) or `fullscript/scripts.js` (full script editable in scripts window) to your PO server directory if you want the chosen script to be loaded when you next start the PO server (`Server.exe`).

Otherwise, copy and paste the content of `autoupdatescript/webcallscript.txt` or `fullscript/serverscript.txt` into the Scripts window (Options > Scripts)  and click OK to load.

### File Location

Make sure your chosen `scripts.js` file is not under any directories such as `autoupdatescript/`, `fullscript/`, `site/`, `usage_stats/` or `usage_stats/formatted/` when adding it to your own PO server directory.

## Announcements and Server Description

Copy and paste the content of `Announcements.txt` and/or `serverdescription.txt` into the Announcement and/or Server Description boxes respectively (Options > Config) and commence editing - if you want to  a starting point for your announcements and/or server description.

## Rules

To create a rules command, type `/writemsgcmd rules*html` into the main chat on the server. Copy the content of `rules.html` and replace the `html` argument with the paste in order to write the default server rules.

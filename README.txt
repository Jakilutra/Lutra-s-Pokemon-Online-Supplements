Save your chosen serverscript.txt (Full Script) or webcallscript.txt (Auto-Update Script) as scripts.js in your PO server directory if you want it to be loaded when you next start the PO server.

Otherwise, copy and paste the content of your chosen file into the Scripts window (Options > Scripts)  and click OK to load.

To create a rules command type /writemsgcmd rules*html into the main chat on the server. Copy the content of rules.txt and replace html with the paste in order to write the default server rules.
